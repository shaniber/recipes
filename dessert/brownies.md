### Ingredients

+ 1/2 cup butter, melted
+ 1 cups sugar
+ 2 eggs
+ 1 tsp vanilla extract
+ 1/3 cup cocoa powder
+ 1/2 cup flour
+ 1/4 tsp salt
+ 1/2 tsp baking powder

### Directions

Preheat the oven to 350 F then grease and flour the sides of a 9 inch square pan, cut a piece of parchment paper to cover the bottom of the pan and leave it there if you want to lift them out easily.

Melt the butter and mix in the sugar. Break the eggs in a large bowl and add some of the butter sugar mixture to temper the eggs. Once that is mixed together add the rest of the butter sugar mixture to the large bowl.

Pour in the vanilla extract then add the cocoa, flour, salt and baking powder. Stir to combine and pour into the pan.

Bake for 25-30 minutes until the top is shiny and a toothpick in the middle comes out clean.

### Yield

A pan full of brownies!
