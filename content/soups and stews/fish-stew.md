# Fish Stew
I had extra pickerel this evening, so I decided to make something a little different.  This stew was pretty rich tasting, and very filling.  It would be very tasty with fresh biscuits, or bannock.

## Directions
Heat the oil in a heavy, large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  Add 
the bacon, and cook until browned.  Add the chopped shallots and garlic, and 
sauté until they are soft. Add the mushrooms and sauté until browned.  Add 
the parsley and stir for 2 minutes.  Add the tomato and tomato paste, lower 
the heat to low, and cook for about 10 minutes.

Turn the heat back up to medium.  Add the clam juice, white wine venegar, 
clams, and fish, and potatoes if you're using them. Simmer for about ten 
minutes.  Add the Tabasco, Worcestershire, and salt.  Turn down the heat to 
low, cover, and simmer for an hour.  

## Yield
Serves four (six if you're using potatoes)
