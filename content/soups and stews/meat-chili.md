# Meat Chili
Presented for one of the zu Chili Cookoffs, this chili was originally built around a moose / pork mixture, but works very well with any meat.  It has a slow building heat, letting you taste all the other flavours first before it slaps you lightly in the mouth.  It can be started the night before, to have it ready for lunch the next day.

## Directions
Brown the meat, seasoning it lightly with salt, pepper, and 1 Tbsp of chili 
powder.  Cook the bacon until slightly crisp.  Drain the fat, crumble, and 
cook with the onion and garlic, until they are soft. 

In a crock or stock pot, add the bacon/onion/garlic mixture.  Add the 
tomatoes, beer, coffee, and hot sauces.  Add in the browned meat, and stir it 
all up.

Add the peppers, half of the spices, and brown sugar.  Bring to a simmer on 
high.  After at least two hours, add the second half of the spices.  An hour 
before serving, add the maple beans and maple syrup.  Finally, just before 
serving, taste to make sure that the heat is as desired.

Serve in bowls. Pairs well with waffles!

## Yield
Enough chili to feed at least 6 people with leftovers for the next day.
