# Tomato Soup with Grilled Cheese Croutons
Yeah, I added this recipe when it was making the rounds, because I thought
it was pretty cool looking, despite it being trendy. The soup is pretty decent,
and the grilled cheese is standard, but a cute addition.

+ 4    slices      country white bread
+ 2    Tbsp        butter, softened
+ 4    slices      yellow American cheese

## Directions
In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. 
Add the onions, and cook over medium-low heat for 15 minutes, stirring 
occasionally, until golden brown. Add the garlic and cook for an additional 
minute. Stir in the chicken stock, tomatoes, saffron, 1 tablespoon salt, 
and 1 teaspoon pepper. Bring the soup to a boil, then lower the heat and 
simmer for 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, fill a medium pot with water, add 2 teaspoons salt and bring 
to a boil. Add the orzo and cook for 7 minutes. Drain the orzo and add it 
to the soup. Stir in the cream, return the soup to a simmer and cook for 
10 more minutes, stirring frequently.

To make the grilled cheese croutons, heat a heavy bottom skillet over 
medium-high heat. Spread butter over one side of the slices of bread, 
placing the 2 slices of cheese in between the unbuttered side. Cook in 
skillet for a few minutes on each side until bread is golden and cheese 
is melted. Remove to a cutting board and let sit 1 minute before cutting 
into 1-inch cubes.

Ladle soup into bowls, top with grilled cheese croutons, and garnish with 
chopped fresh basil or parsley.
