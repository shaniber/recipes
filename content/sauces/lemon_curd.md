## Ingredients
+ 3 unwaxed lemons
+ 200 grams caster sugar
+ 115 grams Unsalted butter, diced
+ 2 large eggs
+ 2 large egg yolks

## Directions
A. Grate the rind of the three lemons into a medium sized heatproof bowl. 
B. Then juice the lemons and add the juice into the bowl.
C. Set the bowl over a pan of warm water and add the sugar and butter. Gently stir until the sugar has dissolved and the butter has melted.
D. Mix the eggs and the egg yolks together.
E. Add the eggs to the mix through a sieve. This is important to do, as it will take out any of the unwanted egg membrane and give you a smoother mixture.
F. Whisk the mixture over a medium heat until it starts to thicken.
G. Keep stirring until the mixture sticks to your spoon. You will get the feel for when it is done.
H. Pour the warm lemon curd into a warm sterilised jar and seal while still warm, and allow to fully cool down.
I. This can be stored in a dark cupboard unopened for up to 1 month. Once opened it must be refrigerated and eaten within 10 days. 

## Yield
1 pound of lemon curd.
