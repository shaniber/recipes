# Caesar Salad Dressing
When you're craving a caesar salad, but you don't have dressing, this 
little number will come to the rescue. Frankly, I think it's better than
any store-bought dressing I've ever had.

## Ingredients
~~~~
+ 2 small garlic cloves, minced
+ 30   ml      freshly squeezed lemon juice, from one lemon
+ 5    ml      Dijon mustard
+ 5    ml      Worcestershire sauce
+ 250  ml      fresh mayonnaise
+ 125  ml      freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
+              salt and pepper to taste
+ 5    ml      anchovy paste (found near the canned tuna)
~~~~

#### Substitutions
The recipe is best if made with fresh ingredients, but here's some 
substitutions if you don't have everything:
~~~~
+ garlic powder for the fresh garlic
+ (light) mayo from a jar
+ grated parmasan for proper Parmigian-Reggiano
+ fish sauce for anchovy paste
~~~~


## Directions
Mix together all the ingredients, adjusting the amounts to your taste. 
Serve immediately, storing the rest in a glass sealer or airtight plastic 
container for up to a week.

## Yield
10 servings, of about 30 ml apiece.
