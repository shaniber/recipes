# Orange Ginger Marinade
This evening, I got a hankering for beef short ribs. You know the kind,
fatty ribs cut flanken-style that had been marinaded in a savoury sauce.
I couldn't decide what kind of sauce to make, so I started poking around 
on the world wide web, as one does. I didn't find a particular recipe, but
I did run into a common theme: ginger and garlic. As I started pulling 
ingredients from my fridge, I saw that I had orange marmelade, and thought
"hey, ginger and orange go well together!" 

This is the results of that experimentation. I cooked my ribs in an Instant
Pot, then broiled them for about 5 minutes a side. It was delicious. This
would also go quite well with chicken.

+ ½    cup     soy sauce

+ 3    tbsp    orange marmelade

## Directions
Lay your ribs out on a baking sheet. Rub one side with half of the brown
sugar, turn over, and rub with the remaining brown sugar. Put the ribs in 
the fridge for about 30 minutes, or until the brown sugar is mostly 
dissolved.

While the ribs are sitting in the sugar, add the rest of the ingredients 
to your food processor. Pulse until the garlic and onion are pulverized,
and all the ingredients are integrated. Adjust to taste.

Put the sugared ribs into a zippered bag, then follow with the marinade.
Remove as much air from the bag as you can and seal it. Let it sit in the
fridge for an hour, up to about a day.

Once marinated, remove from the bag, and cook as you prefer. If using your 
Instant Pot, add all the marinade to the cooking pot, then rinse the bad 
with an additional half cup of water. Add the rinse water to the cooking
pot. Set the Instant Pot to high pressure, and cook for 6 minutes. Allow
a 10 minute natural depressurization, then broil or sear the ribs.

## Yield
Enough marinade for about 6 4-piece flanken cut short ribs.
