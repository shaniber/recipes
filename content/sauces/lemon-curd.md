# Lemon Curd
I have no idea why I have this recipe, other than I stumbled upon it sometime
along the way, decided it looks absolutely delicious, and needed to try it.

I still haven't, but one day!

## Ingredients
~~~~
+ 3            unwaxed lemons
+ 200  g       caster sugar
+ 115  g       unsalted butter, diced
+ 2            large eggs
+ 2            large egg yolks
~~~~

## Directions
Grate the rind of the three lemons into a medium sized heatproof bowl, then 
juice the lemons and add the juice into the bowl. Set the bowl over a pan of 
warm water and add the sugar and butter. Gently stir until the sugar has 
dissolved and the butter has melted.

Mix the eggs and the egg yolks together. Add the eggs to the mix through a 
sieve. This is important to do, as it will take out any of the unwanted egg 
membrane and give you a smoother mixture. Whisk the mixture over a medium 
heat until it starts to thicken. Keep stirring until the mixture sticks to 
your spoon. You will get the feel for when it is done.

Pour the warm lemon curd into a warm sterilised jar and seal while still 
warm, and allow to fully cool down.  This can be stored in a dark cupboard 
unopened for up to 1 month. Once opened it must be refrigerated and eaten 
within 10 days. 

## Yield
1 pound of lemon curd.
