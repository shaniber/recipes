# Guacamole
I had an avocado that was still good, but going soft, so I decided I would 
make some guac for lunch today. Turns out that I had everything but the 
jalapeños, so I subbed in a squirt of sriracha, and it was quite tasty.

~~~~
+ 3            avocados
+ 2            firm medium tomatoes, seeded
+ 1 small      onion, finely chopped
+ ½            bunch of cilantro

~~~~

### Substitutions
- Use 1/2 onion and 1/2 bunch chopped chives, in place of a whole onion.
- Feel free to skip the jalepeño, or substitute your favourite hot pepper 
  or sauce as desired.
- Ground coriander is acceptable in a pinch, if you don't have cilantro. 
  Don't use too much though!

## Directions
Cut the avocados in half, removing the pit, and scraping them out into a
flat bottomed bowl. Smash with a potato masher or fork. Add the onion, 
tomatoes, jalapeños, garlic, live juice, and seasonings, and mix until 
incorporated. 

Serve immediately. If you make this ahead of time, mix everything except 
salt, pepper and cumin. Then, place plastic wrap directly on the guacamole,
and press all of the air out. Add the salt, pepper, and cumin just before
you serve it.
