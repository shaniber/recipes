## Ingredients
+ 1 ltr apple juice
+ 1 ltr liquid honey
+ 2 cups golden yellow sugar
+ 1 cup Dijon mustard
+ ¼ cup grainy mustard
+ 1 tbsp ground ginger
+ 1 tbsp ground cinnamon


## Directions
Preheat the oven to 200 F, put the ham into a suitable size roaster type dish and score the fat side (which is up) in a criss cross/hash tag fashion. If it’s a spiral ham, skip the cross-hatching.  

Combine all ingredients in a pot and simmer on the stove gently to avoid it boiling over, stirring occasionally. Reduce this by half or more so it goes a little syrupy. Save to the side until needed. Takes about 2 hours to fully reduce, maybe a bit longer.  

Once the ham has about 40-50 minutes left, uncover the ham, and turn up the oven to 350 F. Brush the glaze over the ham and place back in the oven for a further 30 minutes (or more, this recipe/instructions are pretty lax, and the ham will turn out basically the same). Continue to brush more glaze every 10 minutes.  

Save some warm glaze to spoon over/brush over each portion of ham at the table.  


## Yield
Enough glaze to cover a large ham that will feed a family of four with plenty of leftovers.
