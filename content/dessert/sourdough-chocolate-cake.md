# Sourdough Chocolate Cake

## Source
I 100% ganked this from my buddy Mark Eramian's facebook, where he had a picture of it and graciously shared his recipe with me. It's a little slap-dash, so when I get around to making it, I'll update the amounts.

## Directions
You do a sourdough sponge and let it ferment for 2-3 hours, then add 
butter, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, salt, soda, egg. Add 3 oz of melted 
unsweetened chocolate, mix it into a nice smooth batter, and bake. Use 
the same sourdough culture you use for bread. 

## Yield
1 Cake, 8-12 servings?
