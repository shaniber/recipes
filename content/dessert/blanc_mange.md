## Ingredients
+ 1 cup milk (1%-3%)
+ 1 egg yolk
+ 1 tbsp corn starch
+ 1/8 cup sugar
+ pinch salt (op)
+ 1 tsp butter (op)

## Directions
In a heatproof bowlm whisk together cornstarch, sugar, egg  yolks, salt, and a splash of milk.

In a heavy bottomed sauch pan, head remaining milk over medium heat. Stir to prevent milk from burning.

Have ready a second heatproof bowl, a strainer, and a heatproof spatula. You will not be able to leave the stove once you start the next step (it will take 5 or 10 minutes) so make sure everything is ready.

Once the milk is just simmering or foamy around the edges and steaming pour slowly into the egg mixture whisking the entire time. Once about half of the milk is whisked in, you can start pouring more quickly and dump the rest in.

Pour the milk and egg mixture back into the saucepan and place over medium heat. Begin stirring with a heatproof spatula.

At first the pudding will be thin and watery. Keep stirring.

After a few minutes you will notice the mixture beginning to thicken. Use the spatula to stir every part of the pan thoroughly and constantly. It may begin to bubble, just keep stirring.

Keep stirring until the pudding is thick enough to coat the spatula and leave a clean line when you pull your finger through it. Remove from heat and pour immediately through a strainer into a clean bowl.

Push the cooked pudding through a strainer to catch any inevitable lumps.

To finish the pudding stir in butter (optional but adds a nice shine) and any desired flavourings. Cover with plastic wrap to prevent a skin forming, and refrigerate a few hours until cool and set.

### Chocolate Pudding:
Stir chopped chocolate into hot pudding. Allow an ounce or two per cup of milk. Use a good quality chocolate that you would eat plain.

### Vanilla Pudding:
Stir in a splash of good quality vanilla extract. Allow a teaspoon or so per cup of milk.

## Yield
2 servings.
