# Brown Sugar Icing
My Dad's favourite birthday cake was the Super Chocolate Cake (see elsewhere
in this recipe book) with brown sugar icing. Since this would be his second 
birthday since his death, I thought I'd whip this up in his memory. I think 
he'd like it. I know my girls and I did.

This isn't the same recipe, I'm sure, that my Mom made when I was young, or 
that Sandra (his wife in his later years) made him. But it tastes pretty 
close, and looks the same, so I'm gonna count it as a win.

Total time: 15 mins  

## Ingredients
~~~~
+ ½    cup     unsalted butter

+ ½    tsp     vanilla

## Directions
In a deep, large saucepan, melt the butter over high heat until it just starts
to boil. Add the brown sugar, and bring back to a boil. Lower the heat to 
medium, and continue to boil for no more than 2 minutes, stirring the mixture
constantly. Add the milk and vanilla. Stir constantly as it returns to a boil.

As soon as it begins to boil, remove from the heat and allow to cool to lukewarm.
Gradually whisk in the confectioners' sugar, then stir with a wooden spoon until 
thick and spreadable. 

## Yield
Enough icing to thinly ice a 9x13 cake, or more generously ice an 8x8 cake.
