# Banana Bread
Classic banana bread is one of the best treats you can make. Not only 
does it use up the leftover bananas that always seem to happen, but it's
sweet and satisfying. This is definitely comfort food at its best. And,
it's perfect for sharing!

Substituting unsweetened applesauce for the butter makes a lower fat, but
equally moist and delicious loaf. And, it doesn't taste like apple!
