# Chocolate Chip Jumbles.
When I was a wee lad, I loved chocolate chip cookies. They were my favourite 
treat. But not just ANY chocolate chip cookie, mind you. I had to have my 
mom's chocolate chip jumbles! Full of oatmeal, nuts, coconut, and chocolate, 
they were, in my young opinion, the perfect cookie. I still think they're 
pretty rad today.

I have no idea where my mom found the recipe. She probably started making 
them before I was born. All I have is her hand written entry in her cook 
book. It suggests that it was handed down to her from her grandmother via her 
sister Carol. It wouldn't surprise me if it came from a Betty Crocker recipe 
book or something, somewhere down the line, and was modified over the years.
