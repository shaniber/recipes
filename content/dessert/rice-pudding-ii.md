# Rice Pudding II
I had a ton of leftover rice from supper tonight, and I decided that I NEEDED 
rice pudding. I didn't have a lot of luck with the previous recipe I had, with
the egg always cooking a little bit separate. It wasn't bad, but I wanted 
better.

So I went hunting again, and found this one. It used evaporated milk, which I
had in my storage shelf, so I figured, why not? 

I'm glad I did... this version is WAY better. The eggs didn't split, and I was
happy as a clam.

+ 2   cups     milk

+ 2   cups     cold rice
+ ½   cup      sugar

## Directions
Combine the sugar, salt, and cornstarch in a medium sized saucepan. Whisk in
the cold milk and cream. Cook this mixture over medium heat until it just 
begins to boil.

Add the rice and return to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower the temperature, 
then use this mixture to temper the eggs. Add about half of the mixture, 
slowly, one spoonful at a time, to the beaten eggs, whisking them constantly. 
Slowly return the tempered eggs to the original saucepan. Lower the heat 
further to low. Continue cooking, stirring constantly without boiling, until 
it is thick and creamy.

Remove the saucepan from the heat and add cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla. Stir 
well until fully combined. Serve warm or cold.

### Additions
You can optionally add raising to the pudding. If you wish to do so, use
about a half cup of raisins. Pour enough boiling water over the raisins to 
cover them, and let them sit for about 10 minutes to plump up. Then drain 
them, and add them to the pudding just before the vanilla and spices.

## Yield
8 half cup servings.
