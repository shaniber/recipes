## Directions
Preheat the oven to 350°F. 

Combine the bread and raisins in a large bowl. Combine the milk and ¼ cup of the butter in a saucepan. Cook the mixture over medium heat until the butter is melted, then pour over the bread. Let this stand for 10 minutes, then stir in all the remaining ingredients. 

Pour everything into a greased casserole dish. Bake for 40-50 minutes, or until it is set in the centre.

### For Sauce
Combine all of the sauce ingredients except the vanilla in a saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens and comes to a full boil. Stir in the vanilla.

Pour the sauce over top of the baked pudding or serve in individual dessert dishes, warm, with the sauce.
