# Hot Fudge Pudding Cake
Yes, I was surprised, too, that it was vegan. :)  Since I'm -not- vegan, 
though, I put animal based milk and butter in, and it was still pretty
darn good!

## Directions
Preheat oven to 350. Put some water on to boil.

Sift together flour, sugar, 2 Tbsp cocoa powder and baking powder. Stir 
in milk and butter and spread mixture as well as you can into an 
ungreased 8x8" pan. It'll be thick, so don't worry about making it 
perfect. In a separate bowl, stir together brown sugar and ¼ c cocoa 
powder. Sprinkle mixture over batter. Pour hot water over batter.

Bake for 45 minutes.

Serve immediately, cut into squares with some of the sauce spooned on 
top, plus a dollop of vanilla ice cream or fresh slices of banana.

## Yield
Serves 6.
