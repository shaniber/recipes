## Ingredients
~~~~
+ 6    oz i    chocolate chips (semi-sweet)
+ 5            slices of smoked bacon

+ 2    oz      flaked almonds
~~~~


## Directions
Cook the bacon until crispy. When it is cool, grind it in a food processor. 

Melt the chocolate completely. If using a waterbath to melt, protect from condensation, as any water in the chocolate can cause it to seize. 

### For the Almond Crunch:
Melt the honey and butter over low heat. Once it is melted completely, increase the heat while watching closely until it starts to bubble and turn golden brown. Add the flaked almonds, and stir well, over medium heat for about two minutes. Turn out onto a non-stick baking sheet to cool. Once cool, grind in a food processor.

### To make the chocoloates:
You will need a silcon or plastic chocolate mold. Paint the holes of the mold with a thin layer or melted chocolate. Mix together the bacon and the almond crunch, and add a small amount to the mold. Put the mold in the refrigerator for about five minutes to allow the chocolate to solidify. Once cold, remove from the fridge, and cover with remaining melted chocolate. Return to the fridge to finish solidifying again. Remove carefully from the mold once solid.


## Yield
A dozen chocolates.
