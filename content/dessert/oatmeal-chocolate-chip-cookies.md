## Directions
Heat oven to 350°F. 

In a large bowl, stir brown sugar and butter until blended. Stir in vanilla and egg until light and fluffy. Stir in oats, flour, baking soda and salt; stir in chocolate chips and nuts.

Drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheet, about 2 inches apart.

Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown. Cool slightly; remove from the cookie sheet to wire rack.

## Yield
36 Cookies

## Notes
Planning for future baking? Drop the dough by spoonfuls on a baking sheet and freeze. Once the mounds of dough are frozen, place them in an airtight container and freeze for up to 12 months. When it's time to bake the cookies, add about 5 minutes to compensate for the frozen dough.

Time saver alert: make the dough up to 24 hours ahead, cover it, and refrigerate till you’re ready to bake. If too firm to scoop, let it stand at room temperature for about 30 minutes.

Stir in old-fashioned oats instead of quick-cooking oats for chewier cookies. For some spice, stir in 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon or 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger into the flour.
