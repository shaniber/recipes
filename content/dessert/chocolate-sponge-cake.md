# The One-Bowl, One-Cup, One-Teaspoon Chocolate Cake

For a little while, I worked with Canadian Baking Sensation Mahathi Mundluru at 7shifts. She was an inspiration in our cooking channel, and everyone upped their game because of her leadership there! This was the last recipe she posted before she moved on, and the picture she added with it was GLORIOUS.
