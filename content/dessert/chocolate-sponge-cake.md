# The One-Bowl, One-Cup, One-Teaspoon Chocolate Cake

For a little while, I worked with Canadian Baking Sensation Mahathi Mundluru at 7shifts. She was an inspiration in our cooking channel, and everyone upped their game because of her leadership there! This was the last recipe she posted before she moved on, and the picture she added with it was GLORIOUS.

## Ingredients

+ 1    tsp     salt
+ 1    tbsp    espresso powder or instant coffee

## Directions
Combine dry ingredients. Add wet ingredients except the water to the dry ingredients and mix until combined. (I do it by hand to avoid adding too much air so my layers will be flat, you can also use a hand mixer which will result in a light dome).  

Slowly add boiling water to the batter until fully combine. The batter will be very runny.  

Prepare either two 8” OR three 6” round pans, OR one 9-10” bundt cake pan. Distribute batter evenly.  

Bake for 30-40min, depending on your oven. Cake should spring bake when lightly pressed and a toothpick should come out clean. Let cool before removing from the pan.


## Yield
One cake.
