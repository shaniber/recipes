# Bread Pudding
I stumbled on this recipe on Facebook. Of course, as everyone knows, 
Facebook is a paragon of attribution, so I really don't know where this
originally came from! I've found the same recipe on at least 20 different
websites. I suspect that the origin might have been the Land-O-Lakes site,
since things like this have a tendency to migrate from the back of some
commercial product over the years. Also, it's been up for at least four 
year before I found it on FB!

## Directions
Preheat the oven to 350°F. 

Combine the bread and raisins in a large bowl. Combine the milk and ¼ cup
of the butter in a saucepan. Cook the mixture over medium heat until the
butter is melted, then pour over the bread. Let this stand for 10 minutes, 
then stir in all the remaining ingredients. 

Pour everything into a greased casserole dish. Bake for 40-50 minutes, or 
until it is set in the centre.

### For Sauce
Combine all of the sauce ingredients except the vanilla in a saucepan. 
Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens 
and comes to a full boil. Stir in the vanilla.

Pour the sauce over top of the baked pudding or serve in individual 
dessert dishes, warm, with the sauce.


## Yield
8 servings (4 if you're hungry.)
