## Directions

### For the donuts

In a large bowl combine flour, nutmeg, sugar and salt together.  

Add the milk and add egg, melted butter and yeast.  

Combine the dry ingredients and the wet ingredients.  

Knead the dough on a work surface for 10 minutes. If you choose to use a stand mixer knead the dough on high for 3 minutes.  

Transfer the dough to a greased bowl, cover and allow the dough to rise for 2 hours.  

Roll out the dough to about 1 inch thickness (DO NOT roll the dough too thin, see the video for visuals) and cut out the donut shapes.  

Place the donuts onto some parchment paper, brush them with melted butter and let them to rise again for another 45 minutes.  

After 45 minutes, preheat your air fryer to 180 °C (350 °F). Once the air fryer has preheated (on my air fryer, an alarm sounds when it’s preheated),  gently place the donuts into the greased basket and cook for exactly 3 minutes.  

Toss the donuts in the glaze or alternatively, if you don't want to glaze these, once the donuts come out of the airfryer and while they're still hot brush the donuts with melted butter and quickly toss them in cinnamon sugar.  

### Glaze The Donuts

Mix together melted butter, warm milk, sugar and vanilla extract.  

Toss the donuts in the glaze and enjoy!  

Alternatively, if you don't want to glaze these, once the donuts come out of the airfryer and while they're still hot brush the donuts with melted  butter and quickly toss them in cinnamon sugar.
