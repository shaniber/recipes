## Directions
Place egg yolks in a large metal bowl; whisk lightly and set aside.  

Place 1¼ cup cream in a small saucepan, and butter in a medium saucepan.  Heat the cream over medium-low heat till warm. 

Meanwhile, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the brown sugar and cook - stirring occasionally - till mixture is covered with bubbles, about 5 minutes.   Slowly add warmed cream, stirring constantly, and cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat.

Clean out the saucepan you used for the cream - fill halfway with water and bring to a simmer. Meanwhile, add milk to the yolks, whisking constantly. Whisk in the cornstarch and salt and continue whisking till blended. Slowly add the butterscotch mixture, whisking constantly.  Set the bowl over the simmering water. Cook for 10 minutes, whisking frequently. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil and cook for another 10 minutes, whisking occasionally.  Take the bowl off the heat; cool for 5 minutes, whisking occasionally.

Pour the pudding into six 8-ounce ramekins. If you want to avoid skin, immediately cover with plastic wrap, making sure that the wrap touches the surface of the pudding. Chill for several hours, till cold.

Beat remaining ¾ cup heavy cream till soft peaks form. Serve puddings with whipped cream and a little cinnamon or grated nutmeg.

(Optional) If making pudding pops, pour pudding into popsicle molds, add sticks and freeze.


## Yield
Six 8-ounce servings.
