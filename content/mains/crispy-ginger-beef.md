# Crispy Ginger Beef
Every once in a while one of my kids will ask me to cook something I 
haven't before, and this was one of them. Surprisingly, this turned out 
great! It tastes basically like the ginger beef I'd get from the various 
restaurants in the city. Turns out it's on our list of memorable foods 
that I make! It's a bit involved, and takes a while to make, but the 
results are worth it. I make extra beef without the sauce to freeze.

## Directions
Slice partially frozen beef into thin strips, cutting along the grain. Cut 
the carrot, bell pepper, and onion into thin strips. Mince the ginger and 
garlic, and dried red chili peppers if you're using them.

Mix the soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, and sesame oil, and set aside.

Mix the cornstarch, eggs, and water to make the batter.

Heat the oil to about 175Â°C. Drop 5 to 6 pieces of beef in the batter, 
coating them thoroughly. Transfer the beef to the hot oil, making sure to 
stretch the pieces straight, and fry until brown. Drain on paper towels.

Add about 15 ml of oil to a wok or frying pan. Add the ginger, garlic, 
and red pepper flakes, and stir fry for about 10-15 seconds. Add the 
carrot, bell pepper, and onion to the pan, and stir fry. Drizzle with 
sesame oil desired or needed. Pour the sauce into the pan, and let simmer 
until it is reduced.

If desired, quickly refry the beef to reheat and recrisp while the sauce 
is simmering. Put the beef in the wok with the sauce and vegetables, toss 
to coat with the sauce and heat through if necessary, then remove from the 
heat.

Serve with rice.

## Yield
Serves 4.
