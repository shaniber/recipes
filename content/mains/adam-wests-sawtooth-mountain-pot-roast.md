# Adam West's Sawtooth Mountain Pot Roast
Today, I learned that Adam West passed away at the age of 88. When
browsing the web, I happened upon [a link to a recent Twitter post that
he made, showing off his latest pot roast for his family](https://twitter.com/therealadamwest/status/823364322449506305). Since it looked
so dang delicious, I thought it fitting to add add it to my own collection
to try. Thanks Adam, for the fun and laffs through the years.

## Directions
Heat over to 425°. Season the meat with salt, pepper, and herbs. Use the 
tip of a knife to make several slits on the surface of the meat. Insert 
garlic into slits.

Heat olive oil in a large black iron skillet over medium heat. Add meat 
and brown the roast on all sides. Spread onion and celery around meat and
place green apple slices on top of roast. Add a couple of inches of hot 
water to the skillet. Cover the skillet tightly with foil and carefully
place in oven. Cook for approximately 3 hours, checking periodically to 
make sure liquid does not completely evaporate.

Place potatoes in a large pot with just enough cold water to cover them. 
Bring to a boil, and then add carrots to the water. Cook for about 2 
minutes until the vegetables are partially cooked. Drain vegetables, 
reserving one cup of the vegetable cooking liquid.

Add the vegetables to the skillet, along with the reserved cooking liquid
and wine. Cook roast for one more hour, and then stir in the peas. 
Continue cooking until the peas are cooked through, about 5 more minutes.
Carefully remove the skillet from the oven. The meat should be fork-
tender. Serve.

## Yield
Serves 6-8 people.
