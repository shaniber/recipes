# Stuffed Peppers
I had some leftover rice that I needed to use up, and some peppers that 
were starting to get soft, so that always means stuffed peppers! 

I decided to go with a vegetarian option, since I didn't have any leftover
ground beef handy, but you could easily sub an equal amount in for the 
black beans.

## Directions
Preheat the oven to 375ºF. Cover a baking tray with foil or parchement 
paper and set it aside.

In a large bowl, combine all of the ingredients except for the bell peppers
and cheese, and mix well. Taste, and season with more salt and pepper if 
desired.

Place the pepper halves face up and stuff with rice mixture. Top with the
parmesan cheese. Cover the tray with another sheet of foil, and bake for
30 minutes.

After 30 minutes, remove the foil and increase the heat to 400ºF. Bake for
an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the peppers are tender.
