## Directions
Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season diced 
sweet potatoes with smoked paprika, cayenne pepper and cumin. Add to 
skillet and sauté for 6-7 minutes, until softened.

In the meantime, de-stem the kale leaves and combine them with remaining 
tbsp of olive oil, salt and pepper in a large mixing bowl. Take bunches 
of kale pieces in both hands, rub them together and repeat for ~5 
minutes. You'll notice a visible change; the leaves will darken, shrink 
in size and become softer in texture. Place massaged kale on cutting 
board and roughly chop into bite-sized pieces.

Add kale and minced garlic to skillet. Sauté for another 5-7 minutes, 
until kale wilts down. Add balsamic vinegar, reduce heat to low and let 
simmer for 2-3 minutes. Top with crumbled honey goat cheese and serve.

## Yield
Serves 3-4; makes roughly 4 cups prepared
