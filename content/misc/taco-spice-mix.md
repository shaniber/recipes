# Taco Spice Mix
At the 2017 zu Summer Solstice party, we decided that our theme would be 
an "Al-inclusive" resort (as we held it at Al Jame's place, natch). Our 
main attraction would be a taco bar. And what's a taco bar without the 
classic of tex-mex cuisine, the ground beef taco?

Rather than just go with packets of seasoning, we found a DELICIOUS spice
mix. It would go very well as a blackening spice for chicken, or sprinkled
over popcorn, too!

## Directions
Mix all the spices together and store in an airtight container. The 
optional black pepper is to increase the spiciness based on your taste.

If you plan on using this regularly, you can increase the amount and it 
will still store well.

## Yield
Enough seasoning for approximately 1 lb. of ground beef, depending on your
taste.
