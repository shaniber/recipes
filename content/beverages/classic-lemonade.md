# Classic Lemonade
Who doesn't love a tall, cool glass of fresh, tart-and-sweet lemonade on
a hot summer's day?

This was served to the zu Ladies during Ladies Day lunch in 2013.

## Directions
Mash lemons, sugar and salt, in large, deep bowl or saucepan with potato 
masher or wooden spoon until lemon slices give up their juice and the 
sugar is dissolved, and juice is thickened to syrup consistency, about 
4 minutes. Pour half the lemon slices and syrup through large sieve over 
bowl or saucepan; press on solids with masher or back of wooden spoon to 
release as much liquid as possible. Discard solids; transfer liquid to 
serving pitcher. Repeat process with remaining lemon slices.  Stir in 
water until blended. Chill well and stir to blend before serving, over 
ice if desired.


## Yield
about 1.5 L
