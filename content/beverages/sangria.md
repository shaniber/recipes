## Directions
Pour wine in the pitcher and squeeze the juice wedges from the lemon and orange into the wine. Toss in the fruit wedges (leaving out seeds if possible) and add sugar and brandy. Chill overnight. Add ginger ale or club soda just before serving. 

Substitute white wine for red if desired.  If club soda is used, the sugar will be necessary.

Any number of other fruits can be added or substituted, as long as about 75 ml each of lemon and orange juice is added.  Substitute citrus soda pop, or gin, brandy or rum. 


## Yield
Almost 2.5 L, enough for 4 people to share.
