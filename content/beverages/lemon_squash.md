## Ingredients
+ Lemons to yield about 2 1/2 cups juice
+ 1 KG white sugar
+ 2 L water
+ 2 t citric acid (optional)


## Directions
Peel the yellow zest from at least half the lemons, making sure not to 
include the white pith of the skins.  Squeeze juice from the fruit and 
reserve. 

Place the rind, sugar and water in a stainless steel pan and warm well 
until the sugar is dissolved and the syrup is a lovely yellow.  Strain out 
the peeled skins, add the fresh lemon juice and citric acid to the syrup 
and store in clean, sterile bottles. 


## Yield
about 2.5 L of juice.
