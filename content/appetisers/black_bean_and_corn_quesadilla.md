## Ingredients
+ 1 (15.5 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
+ 1 (10 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
+ 8 (12 inch) flour tortillas
+ 1 1/2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese, divided
+ 1 tablespoon brown sugar
+ 2 teaspoons olive oil
+ 3 tablespoons finely chopped onion
+ 1 1/2 cup pico de gallo
+ 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
+ 2 tablespoons butter, divided


## Directions
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in onion and red pepper flakes, and cook until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in beans and corn, then add sugar and pico de gallo.  Mix well. Cook until heated through, about 3 minutes.

Melt 2 teaspoons of the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Place a tortilla in the skillet, sprinkle evenly with cheese, then top with some of the bean mixture. Place another tortilla on top, cook until golden, then flip and cook on the other side. Melt more butter as needed, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.


## Yield
Four servings.
