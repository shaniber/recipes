## Directions
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in onion and red pepper flakes, and cook until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in beans and corn, then add sugar and pico de gallo.  Mix well. Cook until heated through, about 3 minutes.

Melt 2 teaspoons of the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Place a tortilla in the skillet, sprinkle evenly with cheese over one half, then top with some of the bean mixture. Fold the tortilla in half, cook until golden, then flip and cook on the other side. Melt more butter as needed, and repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.

Slice into triangles, and serve with sour cream, salsa, or guacamole.

## Yield
Serves four.
