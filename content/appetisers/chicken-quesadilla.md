## Directions
In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add chicken and saute 
until cooked through and juices run clear. Remove chicken from skillet 
and set aside.

Put the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil in the hot skillet and saute 
the sliced onion and green pepper until tender. Stir in the minced garlic 
and saute until the aroma is strong. Mix in half of the pico de gallo and 
chicken breast meat. Set aside; keep warm.

In a heavy skillet, melt ½ tbsp of butter, and place one flour tortilla. 
Spread, across half the tortilla, ⅛ cup shredded cheese and top with ¼ the
chicken mixture. Sprinkle another ⅛ cup cheese over the chicken, and fold 
the tortilla in half. When bottom half is lightly brown and cheese has 
started to melt, flip quesadilla and cook on the opposite side. Repeat 
with remaining ingredients. 

Slice into triangles, and serve with sour cream, salsa, or guacamole.

## Yield
4 servings.
