## Directions
If you are starting with frozen raw shrimp, defrost them by placing them in a bowl of ice water until defrosted. Then poach the raw shrimp for 1 to 2 minutes in boiling water, remove from pan with a slotted spoon, and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking. If you are starting with frozen cooked shrimp, you can defrost them in a bowl of ice water or lemon juice with ice.

Place strained cooked shrimp in a bowl. Add pico de gallo and lime juice. Let marinate for 10 to 30 minutes. Strain out the juice.

Heat a cast iron or stick-free skillet on medium high. Add ½ tbsp of butter and spread it around the bottom of the pan with a spatula. Place one flour tortilla on the skillet. Sprinkle half the tortilla with the grated cheese. Distribute the shrimp mixture on top of the cheese. Fold the other tortilla over. Flip the quesadilla over when the bottom tortilla is nicely toasted and the cheese has begun to melt. Remove the quesadilla from the pan when the now bottom tortilla has toasted sufficiently.

Slice into triangles, and serve with sour cream, salsa, or guacamole. Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro.
