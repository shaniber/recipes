# Couscous with Dried Fruit and Pine Nuts
I made this off the back of the couscous package once, and really liked
it, but couldn't find the recipe again. They changed the dang thing on the
back! But as luck has it, nothing ever really disappears on the Internet,
it just gets hosted on increasingly slower hosts.

## Directions
In a frying pan over medium-low head, toast the pine nuts for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until golden. Set aside.

Bring broth to a boil in a saucepan, covered. Remove from the heat, and stir in the olive oil, couscous, raisins, apricots, and spices. Cover and let stand for 5 to 6 minutes.

Fluff the couscous, then mix in pine nuts and green onion.

Substitute slivered almonds for pine nuts.

Use other dried fruits, such as dried cranberries or cherries.

## Yield
4 servings.
