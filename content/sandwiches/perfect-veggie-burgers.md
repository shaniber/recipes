# Perfect Veggie Burgers
These burgs were made for the 2014 zu Ladies Day lunch. At the time, we
had a vegetarian member on our staff. But she wasn't just a regular...
she also had a severe allergy to soy products! This was a problem, as 
we couldn't use regular store-bought veggie burgs for her. (Also, why 
wouldn't we make something for her, when we're making burgs for everyone
else?)

I recalled that this person had brought her home-made burgers a while 
previously, and they looked pretty spectacular. I had mentioned that, so 
I decided to follow up, a while before the event, and get her recipe.

On the day, when the burgers were rolling out (literally, the waiters 
were our guys on roller skates!), she assumed that she wasn't going to 
be able to eat anything, because we'd have just bought the soy-laden
poison burgers. So imagine her surprise when we brought out her recipe!

## Directions
In a large skillet, sauté onions and garlic in 1/2 tbsp oil. If using 
flax eggs, mix together in a small bowl and set aside for at least 10 
mins while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.

Place all ingredients (except spices and salt) into a large mixing bowl 
and stir very well. Add seasonings and salt to taste.

With slightly wet hands, shape dough into patties. Pack the dough tightly 
as this will help it stick together.

Cook the patties until they are golden and crisp. Frying:in a bit of oil 
on a skillet over medium heat for about 5 minutes on each side. Baking: 
25-30 mins (15-17 minutes on each side) at 350F. BBQ: pre-bake the 
burgers for about 15 minutes in oven before placing on a pre-heated grill.

## Yield
8 hefty patties
