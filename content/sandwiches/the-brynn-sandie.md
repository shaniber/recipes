# The Bryn Sandie
The Bryn Sandie arose from one of my gaming groups. We were running the "Rime of the Frostmaiden" adventure, and our team decided that one of our goals was to open a sandwich shoppe franchise throughout the realm. Since our team was from Bryn Shander, the name arose from there. One of our party came up with the sandwich from suggestions from some AI LLM, based on "a sandwich from ingredients from a Arctic region." We tweaked it to make it our own, and this is what we came up with.
