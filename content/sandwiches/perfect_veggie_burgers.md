### Flax Eggs
+ 2½   tbsp    ground flax 
+ ½    c       warm water


## Directions
In a large skillet, sauté onions and garlic in 1/2 tbsp oil. If using flax eggs, mix together in a small bowl and set aside for at least 10 mins while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.

Place all ingredients (except spices and salt) into a large mixing bowl and stir very well. Add seasonings and salt to taste.

With slightly wet hands, shape dough into patties. Pack the dough tightly as this will help it stick together.

Cook the patties until they are golden and crisp. Frying:in a bit of oil on a skillet over medium heat for about 5 minutes on each side. Baking: 25-30 mins (15-17 minutes on each side) at 350F. BBQ: pre-bake the burgers for about 15 minutes in oven before placing on a pre-heated grill.


## Yield
8 hefty patties
