# Shane's Hamburgers
This mix has been tweaked and altered over many, many years of cooking.
I started with my mom's mix, added in the burg recipes I'd seen while 
working in restaurants, and fixed it up just how I like it. It's really
a toss up between these, and plain grilled ground beef, when I make burgs!

## Source
I made this!

## Ingredients
~~~~
+ 1    lb      hamburger
+ 1            egg
+ ½    cup     oats (or bread crumbs)
+ 1½   tsp     Worcestershire sauce
+ 1    tbsp    brown sugar
+              onion powder
+              garlic powder
+              salt and pepper to taste
~~~~

## Directions
Place all ingredients in a large bowl and mix with your hands until well 
incorporated.  Form into patties.  

Fry or grill patties over medium-low heat until cooked through, with no 
pink in the middle. (If you've ground your own meat, then you could cook
these to a medium level, but unless you're 100% certain of the origin 
and safety of your ground meat, just cook 'em through.)

## Yield
Makes 4 BIG patties, or 8 smaller patties.
