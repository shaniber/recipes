# Classic Pancakes
Everybody's got a pancake recipe, right? The one that's been passed down
from parent to child, that you remember eating as a kid? Well, this is 
mine.

It's really a pretty standard recipe, and I don't know where I found it 
originally. It might have been my dad's, or my brother's. I might have 
found it online. I might have snagged it from a magazine or cookbook 
somewhere along the line. But I've been making this ever since I got tired
of making bad mix-pancakes, and it's the one that my kids ask for when
they say "Dad, make your pancakes, please. Make pancakes. Pancakes. Pancakes.
Pancakes."

Maybe Allrecipes? It's pretty similar to just about every recipe you find
online.

## Ingredients

+ 2    cup     unbleached all-purpose flour or whole wheat pastry flour
+ 2    tbsp    sugar or honey, or to taste
+ 4    tsp     baking powder
+ 1    tsp     salt
+ 2    cup     skim milk
+ Â¼    cup     canola oil
+ 2            egg

## Directions
Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a small bowl. In a 
separate bowl, whisk together milk, oil and egg. Add flour mixture to 
egg mixture and stir just to moisten - a few lumps are fine. Cook pancakes 
on a griddle over medium heat.

### Variations
Add chocolate chips or chopped up fruit to the batter as you pour it. Mix
in cocoa powder for chocolate pancakes. Add bananas and walnuts for cakes
similar to banana bread. Add a lid of vanilla extract. The possibilities
go on and on.

## Yield
16 - 20 pancakes.
