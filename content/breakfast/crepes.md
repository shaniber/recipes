+ 2 large eggs

## Directions
Combine all ingredients. Pulse for about 10 seconds in a blender, or whisk hard for 30-40 seconds in a bowl.  Let the batter sit for about 15 minutes to allow the bubbles to subside.  You can also let it sit in the refrigerator for up to 48 hours; whisk briefly if you do.

Heat a small, non-stick crepe pan, and coat it with butter.  Pour about an ounce of batter into the center of the pan, and swirl it to cover the entire bottom. Cook until the bottom is starting to brown (no more than about 45 seconds), and flip it.  Continue cooking until again they are just starting to brown, and then remove.  


## Yield
12-15 crepes.
