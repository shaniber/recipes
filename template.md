## Ingredients
+ 1/2 cup ingredient one
+ 1 cups ingredient two
+ 2 ingredient three
+ 1 tsp ingredient four


## Directions
Paragraph-style instructions go here.  They are at most 75 characters 
wide, and each line is followed by a carriage return.  Each period is also
followed by two spaces, just because I'm fussy like that.  

This formatting will make it easy to print these someday, as well as 
fitting on a standard text editor page.


## Yield
Number of servings (optional serving size)
